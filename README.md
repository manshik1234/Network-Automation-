# Network-Automation-

Network automation refers to the practice of using software-based solutions to streamline and optimize the management, configuration, provisioning, and operation of computer networks. It leverages various tools, scripts, and technologies to automate repetitive tasks traditionally performed manually by network administrators. This automation can encompass a wide range of network-related activities, including device configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and security enforcement.
Network automation aims to improve efficiency, reduce human error, enhance scalability, and enable agility in network operations. By automating routine tasks, organizations can free up valuable time for IT staff to focus on more strategic initiatives, such as network optimization, innovation, and addressing complex issues.

Network automation with Docker and Ansible combines the power of containerization and configuration management to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of network infrastructure.

Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can be deployed consistently across different environments, making it easier to manage complex network architectures.

Ansible, on the other hand, is a powerful automation tool that simplifies the management of IT infrastructure through declarative configuration files called playbooks. Ansible can automate tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration across a wide range of devices and platforms.
